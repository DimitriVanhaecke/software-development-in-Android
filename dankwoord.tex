At this moment, there is not realy anybody I want to thank as this is the first time I'm publishing this course. Maybe I could thank my girlfriend, but that would be kind of strange as she has done nothing to help me write this document. 

Maybe later, you the student reading and studying this course, could be thanked if you helped by giving feedback, correcting and showing some cool new things in Android. 

But for the time being, I wish you a lot of fun reading and studying this course!
